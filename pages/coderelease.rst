Source Code
===========

The source code behind BlueTides is MP-Gadget. 

A large portion of unused source code in MP-Gadget were inherited from Gadget3, and
are not explicitly licensed as GPL. 

We are making an effort to remove these source code before a full GPL licensed release.

The current version of code is available by request. Please contact Yu Feng at https://github.com/rainwoodman/.
